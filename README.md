# currency_Converter
the currency converter is a small java project created to convert a selected currency, into the valuation of another. The transfer rates were set in September of 2021 and do change.

This project was written inside of Netbeans. This was an optional assignment that I had created when designing a sophmore project for my university degree.
This project was never used as an assignemnt or submitted as such.
